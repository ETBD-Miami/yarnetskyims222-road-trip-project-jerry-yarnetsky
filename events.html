    <h1>Events and Festivals</h1>

        <p>Buffalo's calendar of annual festivals, parades and events is huge and growing. Ethnic pride festivals such as the Buffalo Italian Heritage Festival, and Dyngus Day play a preeminent role, though a diversity of events of all kinds is enjoyed by citizens. Naturally, the lion's share of these festivals take place during the warm months, but efforts have been made recently to expand the slate of offerings to really party in winter as well.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.buffalostpatricksdayparade.com/index.html">Buffalo St. Patrick's Day Parade</a></h3>
                <p>Since 1940, on the closest Sunday to March 17th, downtown Buffalo has been the scene of New York State's second-largest St. Patrick's Day celebration, held by the Buffalo United Irish-American Association. Traditionally, Mass is said by the Bishop of Buffalo at St. Joseph's Cathedral on Franklin Street immediately before the participants gather at Niagara Square, marching up Delaware Avenue. The grandeur of this event is testimony to the continuing importance of Buffalo's Irish-American community.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://dyngusdaybuffalo.com/">Dyngus Day</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Dyngus Day is a traditional Polish holiday that falls on the Monday after Easter; on this day, young boys are known to "slap" girls who catch their eye with pussywillows or squirt them with water guns in a courtship ritual called "śmigus". Today, Buffalo hosts the largest organized Dyngus Day celebration in the world—including Poland, where the festival has largely been forgotten. Since the mid-2000s, Buffalo's annual Dyngus Day celebration has once again been held in the traditional Polish neighborhood of Broadway-Fillmore at the grand old New York Central Terminal, a majestic old Art Deco train station that is yet another of Buffalo's architectural masterpieces that is undergoing extensive restoration. After the Dyngus Day Parade through the streets of Broadway-Fillmore opens the festivities, traditional Polish food and (even more popularly) drink are served in the old dining room, with polka bands attracting revelers to the dance floor. Celebrations are also held at St. Stanislaus, Bishop & Martyr Church (the so-called "Mother Church of Polonia"), the Adam Mickiewicz Library, and the many Polish-owned bars and taverns that continue to soldier on in the old neighborhood. </p>

            <h3><a href="http://www.juneteenthofbuffalo.com/">Juneteenth Festival</a></h3>
                <p>Springing from a commemoration of the abolition of slavery in the state of Texas on June 19, 1865, Juneteenth is celebrated in the black community of the U.S. today as a holiday that signifies African-American pride and cultural heritage. Today, each June 19th sees Martin Luther King, Jr. Park on Buffalo's East Side host the nation's third-largest Juneteenth festival. Beginning with a parade that proceeds westward down Genesee Street from Moselle Street to the park, Buffalo's Juneteenth festival is a lively two-day celebration that includes demonstrations of traditional African and African-American art, music and dance, ethnic foods, crafts and wares, and activities for children. </p>

                <p>With the goal of making Buffalo Niagara one of the premier destinations in the U.S. for garden tourism, Gardens Buffalo Niagara promotes Garden Walk Buffalo, the largest free garden tour in the United States, as well as many other garden walks throughout the various neighborhoods of Buffalo and surrounding communities where participating residents design and maintain beautiful gardens for visitors to enjoy.

            <h3><a href="http://infringebuffalo.org/">Buffalo Infringement Festival</a></h3>
                <p>This new festival, which takes place annually on the last week of July and the first week of August, is a celebration of genre-defying, boundary-pushing DIY art and spectacle by artists who may not have the straight-world cachet or blockbuster budgets that those who display at the Allentown or Elmwood Avenue festivals have. Displays of music, dance, theater, and visual arts, as well as more offbeat genres such as puppetry, fire art, mime, and "miscellaneous insurrection", can be seen at a multiplicity of venues around the city free or for a nominal price. </p>

        <div id="wing-fest" class="event">
        <h3><a href="http://www.buffalowing.com/">National Buffalo Wing Festival</a></h3>
        <p>Each Labor Day weekend sees Coca-Cola Field in downtown Buffalo host the National Buffalo Wing Festival, two days dedicated to Buffalo's best-known addition to the annals of American cuisine. Inspired by the 2001 movie "Osmosis Jones" as well as a column by iconic Buffalo News editorialist Donn Esmonde, the National Buffalo Wing Festival has, since its inception, drawn nearly 600,000 hungry guests from all 50 states and 33 foreign countries to Buffalo, who have collectively eaten over 3 million chicken wings and raised over $200,000 for various local charities. Showcased by a long list of national media such as "The Today Show", "The View", "Live with Regis and Kelly", numerous Food Network series, and even a PBS documentary, the National Buffalo Wing Festival sees over 30 restaurants in Buffalo and around the country—including the Anchor Bar, where chicken wings were first served in 1964—serve up their individual recipes and compete for prizes. </p>

        <div class="event">
        <h3><a class="red" href="http://www.worldslargestdisco.com/">The World's Largest Disco</a></h3>
        <p class="red">The largest event of its kind in the world, the World's Largest Disco brings back the 1970s for one day each Thanksgiving Day weekend, with the Buffalo Convention Center transformed into New York State's largest dance floor. Every year, thousands of locals and visitors age 21 and over dance the night away to the retro tunes that are played on the festival's 500,000-watt soundsystem, and have the chance to meet disco-era celebrities that have included Henry Winkler, Erik Estrada, Leif Garrett, and the cast of "The Brady Bunch". The World's Largest Disco has been featured on the front page of the Wall Street Journal as well as such television programs as "CBS This Morning", VH-1's "Where Are They Now", and the Travel Channel's "Secrets". All proceeds go to benefit Camp Good Days and Special Times, a local summer camp for children with cancer. </p>

<div class="event">
            <h3><a href="http://www.bfloparks.com/">Flurrious!</a></h3>
                <p>Held annually at Delaware Park, this brand-new addition to Buffalo's growing array of annual events is not only a celebration of the winter season for which Buffalo is well-known, but also has as a primary mission the preservation of, appreciation for, and investment in Buffalo's system of Olmsted parks. The 2012 Flurrious! festival included a foot race around Delaware Park's Ring Road, bike ride, snow golfing, snow tennis, igloo building, kickball tournament, live music all day, and food and drink in a heated tent at the Parkside Lodge.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.buffalogardens.com/blogs/news/lumagination-2020-will-wow-crowds-this-winter-at-the-botanical-gardens">Lumagination</a></h3>
                <p>This is how Buffalo does winter. Lumagination is a celebration of light in the original City of Light (Buffalo was the first city to have its streets illuminated by electric power generated from nearby Niagara Falls). Held at the Buffalo Botanical Gardens, this is a perfect wintertime diversion for lovers of horticulture, architecture, art and design. </p>
